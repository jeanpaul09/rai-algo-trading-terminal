Subject: API Integration Request - WesellCellular Order Management

Dear WesellCellular Technical Team,

We are a B2B reseller platform looking to integrate directly with WesellCellular for order management and inventory synchronization. 

Currently, we are using PhoneX as a middleware, but we would like to build a direct integration with your platform.

**Questions:**

1. **Do you have a REST API** for order management and inventory synchronization?
2. **Is API access available** for integration partners?
3. **What endpoints are available** for:
   - Order creation and management
   - Order status tracking
   - Inventory synchronization
   - Pricing updates
4. **What authentication method** do you use (API keys, OAuth, etc.)?
5. **Is API documentation available** for developers?

**Our Use Case:**
- Forward orders from our platform to WesellCellular
- Track order status in real-time
- Sync inventory levels
- Receive notifications on order updates

We are committed to building a professional, reliable integration and would appreciate any information about API access.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
